The goal of this project was to solidify core concepts and skills taught in the DALI introduction to Data Viz series by implementing an open ended project demonstrating something interesting with Data.

It is widely known that America's top colleges are becoming more selective every year, But there are very few sources online that visually demonstrate just how drastic the changes in admission standards have become over the last 2 decades alone.

For this project I implemented a react web app using the d3.js library to create a stacked bar graph showing how the admission rate for the ivy league as a whole has changed from the class of 2006 to the class of 2025. My chart takes advantage of existing color schemes by using the official color of the school to represent it in the graph.

Takeaways from the class/project:

1. How to use d3.js with React. Specifically: choosing the best method for a specific use case (pie charts begone), How to appropriately label, scale, color, and customize a variety of graphs, and gained a general awareness of extremely powerful dataviz toolkits.
2. A better sense of good Data viz principals: good contrast, use of dimensionality, accessibility considerations.
3. Bar charts should start at 0, be ordered by magnitude, have an appropriate scale, and minimize "chart junk"
4. Getting into the Ivy League is harder now than ever before, and average acceptance rates have more than halved.

Some good next steps:

1. I have more ideas for where to take this project. Specifically I think it would be interesting to vizualize how students moving through the admissions process would have fared today versus 20 years ago, or perhaps how the scene changes when considering that some schools receive many more applicants than others.

2. I am applying both to the Difuse Scholarship Program and the DALI lab where I hope to learn even more about the exciting world of Data Viz/Software and use what I learned in this class to help make Dartmouth projects even more truly awesome.
